# Go
From the [[Ansible#Ansible by a dummy|Ansible document sources]] there is an introduction to Go. I normally would skip these kind of introductions to languages. However, this time, I fancied a look.

The big thing about Go is that compiling your code will result in a single .exe file with all the dependencies inside of it. Which is quite a thing to be honest. 

Inside the src folder you will find a folder name 'golang'. All my adventures will be put in there.
