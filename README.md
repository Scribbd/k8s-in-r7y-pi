# K8s-in-R7y-pi
Or simply said: Kubernetes in Raspberry pi.

A repository containing my [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) vault and the source files of my learning process. To get started look at [01_Docker in Cluster Project](./01_Docker%20in%20Cluster%20Project.md)

I am doing this project while I am working for [TechGrounds](https://techgrounds.nl). Goal is to expand my knowledge of popular product of our clients so I can teach the next generation of Tech how to use it.
