# Ansible by a dummy
I have collected the following resources to learn ansible:
 - [Ansible 101 with Jeff Geerling](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2_OBreMn7FqZkvMYt6ATmgC0KAGGJNAN)
	 - Nice 15+ hours hands-on introduction into ansible
 - [Ansible for Kubernetes by Jeff Geerling](https://leanpub.com/ansible-for-kubernetes)
	 - Followup book on the series going into specifics concerning Kubernetes
	 - This book seems to be outdated by a year

## Automation goals
 - Automate hardening of Raspbian
 - Set UASP on the devices that support it
 - Install K8s on the RPi's
 - Configure the master and worker node
 - Configure Longhorn
 - (And more to come)
